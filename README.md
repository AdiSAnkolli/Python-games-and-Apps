These are all the projects made by me using the turtle module and pygame module.
1. connect4.py --> For making this game I have used the pygame module. Connect4 is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
    
    The pieces are to be manoeuvred over the top of the board using your mouse and simply 'left-click' to drop the piece in the particular block. 
    
2. pong.py --> Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The Game has been designed using the turtle module.

    The paddle for player A can be moved using w(up), s(down), a(left) and d(right).
    
    The paddel for player B can be moved using up, down, right and left arrow keys.
    
3. snake.py --> Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. This game too has been made using the turtle module. 
    
    The snake is to be maneuvered using the arrow keys up, down, left and right.
    
4. to_do_list.py --> The goal was to create a simple "To do list" to keep track of the jobs you need to finish. The program has been designed using the Tkinter module (Standard GUI Library for Python). 

    This To-do-List program can perform jobs such as Adding Tasks, Deleting tasks, Sorting the tasks (Either in Ascending or Descending order), Displaying a Random Task, and Displaying the total no. of tasks currently stored in the To-do-List.
